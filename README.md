# Cypress training
Tests are located in `cypress/integration` folder.
First two folders `1-getting-started` and `2-advanced-examples` are test suites created automatically by cypress.

Running tests:
`npm test` will run cypress (we've added this custom command to `package.json`)

## Module 1
Let's get familiar with first basic test. Read the code and run your first test `todo.spec.js`.

## Module 2
More commands. Read the code and run your second test `actions.spec.js`

## Module 3
Now the fun part. We're going to write our own tests.
