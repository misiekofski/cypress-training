# Cypress training
Tests are located in `cypress/integration` folder.
First two folders `1-getting-started` and `2-advanced-examples` are test suites created automatically by cypress.

Running tests:
`npm test` will run cypress (we've added this custom command to `package.json`)

## Module 0a - Getting Started

## Module 0b - Advanced Examples
More commands. Read the code and run your second test `actions.spec.js`
